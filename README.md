# smart-road-pathway-intelligence-
design a smart street model based on an electrical circuit.

The model includes: 
1. A smart barrier that opens automatically when a car approaches.
 2. Smart street lights that turn on when cars pass.

How does the project work?
1. Smart Barrier:
A sensor is used to detect the car. When the car approaches, a signal is sent to the Arduino to trigger the barrier and open it.

2. Smart Street Lights:
A sensor is used to detect the car's movement, and the street lights are automatically turned on.


Our Project and the Role of the Electrical Circuit:

The project relies on the components of an electrical circuit:
Power Source: To power the Arduino and sensors.
Connectors: To conduct signals and power between the various components.
Electronic Devices: Such as sensors and lights that operate when current flows.

Benefits of the Project:

Improves road safety.

The project is scalable to include additional features.

Reduces energy consumption thanks to self-illumination.

Helps learn and apply physics in a practical way.

Demonstrates how an electrical circuit can be used in innovative ways.
